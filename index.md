### About Me
- I am a computer science student at the University of Illinois, graduating May 2022 with my BS and MCS degrees.
- My personal interests include distributed systems, networking, algorithms, and programming paradigms and languages. 
- My contact information can be found on this page, as well as an up-to-date resume. 

### Places I've worked
- DID A THING while interning at **Akuna Capital**.
- DID A DIFFERENT THING while interning at **Cloudflare**, during Spring 2021.
- Designed a customer-facing network diagnostic tool while interning at **Cloudflare**. The tool gathers information like latency and packet routes from Cloudflare's 200 data centers, and gives customers visibility into networking issues ([Documentation](https://api.cloudflare.com/#diagnostics-traceroute)). 
- Built an internal claims auditing application while interning at **Gallagher Bassett**. The application automated several processes, and allowed audit turnaround times to reduce from two weeks to 1-2 days.
- Worked as course staff for **CS 374 - Intro to Algorithms and Models of Computation**. I led discussion sections, graded assignments and exams, and helped students in office hours.
- Maintained and updated the [UIUC honors program website](https://honors.illinois.edu), as well as the admissions databases and applications, and an internal degree tracking system (**Campus Honors Program, UIUC**).

### Projects I've worked on
- DID A TRADING PROJECT
- Designed a command-line stock ticker tool written in Go, which formats data for the Ledger accounting suite (**[Ledger Stock Update](https://github.com/adchari/LedgerStockUpdate)**). 
- Built a net-zero solar smart home with **Illinois Solar Decathalon**.
- Designed the **[CS 233 website](https://cs233.github.io)**.
- Created a VR quiz application for **Gies Labs**, a research group within the University of Illinois' Gies College of Business.
- Created an audiovisual quiz interface for **Child's Voice**, a school for students with hearing disabilities. 

### Other Interests
- Learning more about Linux, Docker, and Kubernetes
- Using Emacs as an operating system ([M-x butterfly](https://xkcd.com/378/))
- Typesetting everything in $\LaTeX$
- Learning Go and Rust so I can write less C/C++
- Writing just enough Haskell to be unhappy with other languages, but not enough to actually use Haskell for anything
- Complaining about retyping my resume in every application system
