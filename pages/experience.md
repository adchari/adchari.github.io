# Experience

### AR/VR in the Classroom
*Undergraduate Researcher* **2019 - Present**
Working under Professor Robert Brunner to analyze data related to the usage of AR/VR technologies
in the classroom, as a part of the College of Business research group, Gies Labs. I am currently building an application for an accountancy class where students can take a quiz and learn a chapter in VR.

### ClassTranscribe
*Web Developer* **2019 - Present**
Working with Professor Lawrence Angrave and his team to develop a university web application to
automatically transcribe lecture videos for students with hearing disabilities. The application generates text from the audio and converts it into a subtitle file.

### Campus Honors Program
*Tech Administrator* **2018 - Present**
Responsible for maintaining the honors admissions database, complying to University requirements,
and maintaining/extending the honors program website. I personally extended the website with a portal for students to view their graduation requirements.

### Child's Voice
*Volunteer Web Developer* **2016 - 2018**
Built a web application for a local private school for students with hearing disabilities. The application helped these children train their ears to comprehend words. In addition, the teachers had a portal to access how each student was doing on their assigned activites.
